## Log

### 20190320 - Day 63

1. Decided to start this log for the 2nd time and in a more personal way to make the process sustainable on the long term

1. Explored a few things about JAMstack  
[FCC Medium article 1](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/freecodecamp-is-hosting-a-free-hackathon-at-github-in-san-francisco-and-an-online-hackathon-too-2078088df278)  
[FCC Medium article 2](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/winners-from-the-2018-freecodecamp-jamstack-hackathon-at-github-2a39bd1db878)  
[FCC article](https://hackathon.freecodecamp.org/)  
[JAMstack website](https://jamstack.org/)  
[JAMstackParis website](https://jamstack.paris/)  
[Also jamstack.wtf](https://jamstack.wtf/)

##### Ideas: 
* Should dig into this thing, go to the Paris meetups and probably have a side project to create a website using Gatsby and Netlify
* Should also investigate about non-content APIs

##### Question: will there be a fCC JAMstack hachathon on 2019? That'd be fun :smiley:

##### Remembered about this: [codeweek.eu](https://codeweek.eu/about/)

#### Today's progress: a lot of things on the Portefolio project

### 20190325 - Day 66 (Monday)

#### Today's progress:

- [x] Still adding the content in the Tech Doc project

#### Thoughts:
Tempted to get a picket for Eve Porcello workshop in London on May, 2nd 2019, the day before ReactJSGirl. It's on GraphQL and it would be the perfect opportunity to pratice GraphQL with React
Also hecked her GraphQL course on LinkedIn
As soon as I'm done with reviewing/ practicing React, GraphQL sounds so tempting.

A lot of things to do concerning the images.
I MUST stop testing new ideas all the time and focus on finishing. I will fine-tune later in the reasonable remaining time.

### 20190411 - Day 78 (Thursday)

Even very simple, it's a bigger thing than I thought and I'm doing a good job with the animations and visual effects.  
A few things to finish and the responsive nav with a burger.   
Could have been a good idea to make it mobile-first (Cf. Makers website). Will try that with another project.  
- [x] prepare the slides for the code intro talk I'm giving in 10 days
- [x] prepare for the fCC Paris meeting of next Saturday<br>

##### Got some feedback on the Minautor project => move on
