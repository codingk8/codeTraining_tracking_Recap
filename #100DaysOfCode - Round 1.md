## Log

### 20190320 - Day 63

1. Decided to start this log for the 2nd time and in a more personal way to make the process sustainable on the long term

1. Explored a few things about JAMstack  
[FCC Medium article 1](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/freecodecamp-is-hosting-a-free-hackathon-at-github-in-san-francisco-and-an-online-hackathon-too-2078088df278)  
[FCC Medium article 2](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/winners-from-the-2018-freecodecamp-jamstack-hackathon-at-github-2a39bd1db878)  
[FCC article](https://hackathon.freecodecamp.org/)  
[JAMstack website](https://jamstack.org/)  
[JAMstackParis website](https://jamstack.paris/)  
[Also jamstack.wtf](https://jamstack.wtf/)

Ideas: 
* Should dig into this thing, go to the Paris meetups and probably have a side project to create a website using Gatsby and Netlify
* Should also investigate about non-content APIs

Question: will there be a fCC JAMstack hachathon on 2019? That'd be fun :smiley:
