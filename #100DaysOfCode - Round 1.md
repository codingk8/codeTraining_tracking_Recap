The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on December 21, 2018.

## Log

### 20190320 - Day 63

1 Decided to start this log for the 2nd time and in a more personal way to make the process sustainable on the long term

1 Explored a few things about JAMstack
[FCC Medium article 1](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/freecodecamp-is-hosting-a-free-hackathon-at-github-in-san-francisco-and-an-online-hackathon-too-2078088df278)
[FCC Medium article 2](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/winners-from-the-2018-freecodecamp-jamstack-hackathon-at-github-2a39bd1db878)
[JAMstack website](https://jamstack.org/)
[JAMstackParis website](https://jamstack.paris/)

#### Idea: should dig into this thing, go to the Paris meetups and probably have a side project to create a website using Gatsby and Netlify<br>Should also investigate about non-content APIs

#### Question: will there be a fCC JAMstack hachathon on 2019? That'd be fun :smiley:
