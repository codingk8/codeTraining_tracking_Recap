## 20190320 - Day 63

__Decided to start this log for the 2nd time__ and in a more personal way to make the process sustainable on the long term

__Today's progress:__ a lot of things on the Portefolio project

__Exploration:__ JAMstack  
[FCC Medium article 1](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/freecodecamp-is-hosting-a-free-hackathon-at-github-in-san-francisco-and-an-online-hackathon-too-2078088df278)  
[FCC Medium article 2](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/winners-from-the-2018-freecodecamp-jamstack-hackathon-at-github-2a39bd1db878)  
[FCC article](https://hackathon.freecodecamp.org/)  
[JAMstack website](https://jamstack.org/)  
[JAMstackParis website](https://jamstack.paris/)  
[Also jamstack.wtf](https://jamstack.wtf/)

__Ideas:__
* Should dig into this thing, go to the Paris meetups and probably have a side project to create a website using Gatsby and Netlify
* Should also investigate about non-content APIs

__Question:__ will there be a fCC JAMstack hachathon on 2019? That'd be fun :smiley:

__Remembered about this:__ [codeweek.eu](https://codeweek.eu/about/)

Tempted to get a ticket for Eve Porcello workshop in London on May, 2nd 2019, the day before ReactJSGirl. It's on GraphQL and it would be the perfect opportunity to pratice GraphQL with React
Also checked her GraphQL course on LinkedIn
As soon as I'm done with reviewing/ practicing React, GraphQL sounds so tempting.
