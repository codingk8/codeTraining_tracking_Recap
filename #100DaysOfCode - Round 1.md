## Log

### 20190320 - Day 63

1. Decided to start this log for the 2nd time and in a more personal way to make the process sustainable on the long term

1. Explored a few things about JAMstack  
[FCC Medium article 1](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/freecodecamp-is-hosting-a-free-hackathon-at-github-in-san-francisco-and-an-online-hackathon-too-2078088df278)  
[FCC Medium article 2](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/winners-from-the-2018-freecodecamp-jamstack-hackathon-at-github-2a39bd1db878)  
[FCC article](https://hackathon.freecodecamp.org/)  
[JAMstack website](https://jamstack.org/)  
[JAMstackParis website](https://jamstack.paris/)  
[Also jamstack.wtf](https://jamstack.wtf/)

##### Ideas: 
* Should dig into this thing, go to the Paris meetups and probably have a side project to create a website using Gatsby and Netlify
* Should also investigate about non-content APIs

##### Question: will there be a fCC JAMstack hachathon on 2019? That'd be fun :smiley:

##### Remembered about this: [codeweek.eu](https://codeweek.eu/about/)

#### Today's progress: a lot of things on the Portefolio project

### 20190325 - Day 66 (Monday)

Tempted to get a picket for Eve Porcello workshop in London on May, 2nd 2019, the day before ReactJSGirl. It's on GraphQL and it would be the perfect opportunity to pratice GraphQL with React
+ Checked her GraphQL course on LinkedIn
As sonn as I'm done with reviewing/ practicing React, GraphQL sounds so tempting.

#### Today's progress:

1. Still adding the content in the Tech Doc project

---

### 20190326 - Day 67 (Tuesday)

Which I could start coding earlier in the day and would have less busy mornings with stuff :weary:

#### Today's progress:

1. Still adding the content in the Tech Doc project (yep, another day of that, but things are moving on!)
1. Hope to do something about the Bull projects :ox:
