## 20190523 - Thursday - Day 84

__Today's progress:__
- [x] CSS Picasso final version, fCC RWD Landing page project first draft  
- [x] fCC RWD Landing page project: created the structure and moving on with the content 

__Link to work:__ [CSS Picasso](https://codepen.io/codingk8/pen/NVywrR?editors=1100)  
__Thoughts:__ I need a visual paper tool with each week's targets. I must keep things under my nose or I loose track of them.

## 20190522 - Wednesday - Day 83

__Today's progress:__ finished the new version of the Picasso challenge for fCC7.0  
__Link to work:__ [CSS Picasso v2](https://codepen.io/codingk8/full/XwVVKW)  
__Thoughts:__ It was all way easier than I feared. Supressing the flexbox was eye-openning. Interesting how I tend to forget the simple things while I learn more complicated ones. Like centering horizontally with "margin: auto;", or creating columns with "display: block;". Quite funny.

__fCC Paris animation:__ It seems the Meetup hosted by Algolia is happenning! I'm over the moon :moon:

## 20190521 - Tuesday

__fCC Paris Community management:__ follow-up with the sponsor of the lastest meetup, updated fCC forum, posted on the slack...  
Also wrote that post about ALLLLL my ideas to grow the fCC local group in Paris. Such an inspiring project :star:

__Thoughts:__ I can feel things slowly moving forward in the right direction. So ready for some positive change and some more stability.

## 20190520 - Monday

__Today's progress:__ organized and updated the resources pages, worked on the learning path next steps, not a lot of code but fastforward in clarity. Also went to the hospital to visit.

__Thoughts:__ Stressful challenging week ahead. Will do my best but don't expect miracles.

## 20190519 - Sunday

## 20190518 - Saturday

__Event organization and animation:__ freeCodeCamp Paris meetup #6 + Ladies Of Code "side-projects" meetup

## 20190517 - Friday

__Today's progress:__ Fine-tuned the fCC Landing page project frame

## 20190516 - Thursday

__Today's progress:__ Some GitHub usefulness and beautification

__Actions:__ very positive hangout with Kris about the CSS Picasso project.  
Next steps are: fix the 4 issues, validate the final draft, create the steps  
In the meantime, I can fork & clone the repo + create a branch + create the directory structure...

__Thoughts:__ Enthousiasm and focus/priorities

## 20190515 - Wednesday - Day 82

__Today's progress:__ Finished the first draft of CSS Picasso and sending it on GitHub - All on [this tweet](https://twitter.com/codingk8/status/1128693825218797569)

__Link to work:__ [CSS Picasso](https://codepen.io/codingk8/full/qGOXmM?editors=1100)

__Thoughts:__ It feels good when my brain is in the flow

## 20190514 - Tuesday - Day 81! YES!

__Today's progress:__ Working on the Picasso project for fCC 7.0. Done 80%. Asked the question about Responsive that is a bit difficult because of the triangles and border-width accepting only pixels. Will finish and submit tomorrow.

__Thoughts:__ Organize and find the flow  
A full empty week, empty days, each day with one main coding task and 3 add-ons and the everyday mundane (up to 3 as well), that sounds like the best routine. Then mix passion with discipline. Procrastination is alsways an indication of some kind of conflict. Find it and solve it to get back in the flow.  
Will organized those at least 3 empty days per week.  
Should also give a try to 3 days / 1 days off rhythm to see how it work. May be a bit mùore difficult to organize but let's see.

## 20190513 - Monday - Not enough code

__Today's progress:__ Did some research about the logo for the Landing page project. Wrote a list of ideas and possibilities. Will spleep on it while I finish the Picasso project.

__Thoughts:__ It's all a journey, there's no destination. Make everyday an amazing day!

__Inspiration:__ [Liz Gilbert Ted Talk on creative genius](https://www.ted.com/talks/elizabeth_gilbert_on_genius?)  
Code is definitely a creative activity

## 20190512 - Sunday

__Thoughts:__ Life feels better with some sun :sun:

__Ideas:__
