## 20190518 - Saturday

__Event organization and animation:__ freeCodeCamp Paris Meetup #6 + Ladies Of Code "side-projects" meetup

## 20190517 - Friday

__Today's progress:__ Fine-tuned the fCC Landing page project frame

## 20190516 - Thursday

__Today's progress:__ Some GitHub usefulness and beautification
- [ ] Framing the Landing page project (create the GH account, create the repo, create the structure, work on the webpack boiler plate, review SASS...)
- [ ] Fix the image link in the projects GitHub readmes

__Actions:__ very positive hangout with Kris about the CSS Picasso project.  
Next steps are: fix the 4 issues, validate the final draft, create the steps  
In the mentime, I can fork & clone the repo + create a branch + create the directory structure...

__Thoughts:__ Enthousiasm and focus/priorities

## 20190515 - Wednesday - Day 82

__Today's progress:__ Finished the first draft of CSS Picasso and sending it on GitHub - All on [this tweet](https://twitter.com/codingk8/status/1128693825218797569)

__Link to work:__ [CSS Picasso](https://codepen.io/codingk8/full/qGOXmM?editors=1100)

__Thoughts:__ It feels good when my brain is in the flow

## 20190514 - Tuesday - Day 81! YES!

__Today's progress:__ Working on the Picasso project for fCC 7.0. Done 80%. Asked the question about Responsive that is a bit difficult because of the triangles and border-width accepting only pixels. Will finish and submit tomorrow.

__Thoughts:__ Organize and find the flow  
A full empty week, empty days, each day with one main coding task and 3 add-ons and the everyday mundane (up to 3 as well), that sounds like the best routine. Then mix passion with discipline. Procrastination is alsways an indication of some kind of conflict. Find it and solve it to get back in the flow.  
Will organized those at least 3 empty days per week.  
Should also give a try to 3 days / 1 days off rhythm to see how it work. May be a bit mùore difficult to organize but let's see.

## 20190513 - Monday - Not enough code

__Today's progress:__ Did some research about the logo for the Landing page project. Wrote a list of ideas and possibilities. Will spleep on it while I finish the Picasso project.
